## Birth and Lineage

Kunti, in her childhood, had served the great sage *Durvasa* with utmost reverence and honour. Satisfied with her duty and service, Durvasa gave her a mantra and said that she could obtain a son from whichever god she would invoke. 

Due to the curse of a rishi, Kunti’s husband *Pandu* couldn’t obtain a child in the normal way for fear of death. When Pandu came to know about Kunti’s boon, he wished for three sons. Kunti gave the mantra to her co-wife Madri, and she had two sons. In this way, Pandu had five sons, known as *Pandavas*.

Pandu wished his first child to represent dharma as he would be the future king of Hastinapur. Therefore, Kunti obtained Yudhishthira from *Dharma*.

Unlike his brothers, renowned for strength or archery, Yudhishthira’s defining quality was restraint governed by conscience. He was known to be truthful and stable in the face of calamity. All his brothers worshipped him and obeyed his every word.

## Major Episodes

- *Game of dice and exile*: Lost his kingdom and possessions in the rigged game of dice, which led to the Pandavas’ thirteen-year exile, including a year incognito.

- *Good conduct*: While in the 13-year exile, Yudhishthira devoted himself to serving the brahmanas. He listened to the advice of all the rishis who came along, like Markandeya, Lomasha, Shamatha, etc. 

- *Tests of character*: Yudhishthira was tested three times by his father, Dharma, once during the 13 years and twice while he went to heaven (in Mahaprasthana parva). He also gave all the answers satisfactorily to Nahusha, his forefather, when Nahusha had captured Bhima as an *ajagara* (boa-constrictor).

- *Kurukshetra War*: Leader of the Pandava faction, he acted as their moral and political head. He uttered a partial truth to Drona, which helped in slaying *Drona*, due to which he first went to hell before going to heaven.

- *Reign and retirement*: Crowned king of Hastinapura after the war, he ruled as the king for 36 years. After hearing the death of Krishna, he, along with his brothers and Droupadi, undertook the great ascent (*Mahaprasthana*).

## Role in Mahabharata

- Before the war began, Yudhishthira went to *Bhisma, Drona, Kripa* and *Shalya* on the battlefield and took their blessings. Bhisma and Drona were deeply affected by this act and didn’t curse Yudhishthira of defeat.

- There were many times when Yudhishthira had shown his skills by invoking *brahmastra* and countering warriors like Drona, Duryodhana, etc.

- On the 15th day, he uttered the fateful half-truth, *Asvatthama hatah*, which made Drona lose control and throw his weapon. *Dhristadyumna* then killed Drona.

- Most people know about Arjuna’s devotion to Krishna, but Yudhishthira also had absolute faith and complete surrender to Krishna.

- Yudhishthira performed the *Rajasuya* sacrifice after establishing *Indraprastha*. Arjuna, Bhima, Nakula and Sahadeva defeated all the kings, thus establishing imperial sovereignty. This intensified *Duryodhana’s* envy, thereby accelerating the Mahabharata war.

- After victory at Kurukṣetra, he was overcome with remorse and sought renunciation. Many rishis advised him not to renunciate. Finally, Bhisma gave Yudhishthira wisdom about all kinds of dharma.

- It took Arjuna only 18 chapters of the Bhagavad Gita (within *Bhisma Vadha Parva*) to understand his dharma. However, it took the entire *Shanti Parva* and more to pacify Yudhishthira. From this, we can see the immense responsibility of a king.

- In the *Mahaprasthana*, he alone advanced toward heaven in his mortal body, refusing to abandon the faithful dog, later revealed as Dharma. Thus, he passed the final test. Yudhishthira saw all his brothers, grandfathers, and relatives in heaven in their own abodes.

## Words of Wisdom 

> Dharma is not convenience; it must be upheld even when it results in humiliation, exile or loss.

> Truth (satya) stands supreme, yet truth requires wisdom (viveka) and compassion (daya) to avoid becoming rigid or destructive. Forgiveness (kshama) is portrayed as a strength rooted in mastery of ego, not weakness. His life demonstrates that dharma is contextual (sukshma-dharma)

> In the celebrated Yaksha Prashna dialogue, he declares that the greatest wonder is that humans witness death daily yet live as though immortal—revealing existential insight into ignorance (avidya).
