## Birth and Lineage

He is the son of *Santanu* and *Ganga*. Santanu was the great king of the Lunar dynasty. He married Ganga, and they had eight children. Those children were actually the *Vasus* who were born on Earth due to a curse from Sage Vasistha. To liberate them from human lives, Ganga threw the first seven to the river, but while she was about to throw the eighth child, Santanu stopped her. 

Ganga didn’t drown the child and took him with her. He was taught by the great *Parashurama* and was known by the name of Devabrata. Later, Ganga handed Devabrata to Santanu. The child served his father and quickly became popular in *Hastinapur*.

## Devabrata's vow

After a few years, Santanu fell in love with *Satyavati*, the daughter of a fisherman. Satyavati’s father agreed to give his daughter to Santanu, but put a condition that Satyavati’s son would be the next king. Santanu didn’t accept the condition and refused, but became miserable. 

Devabrata enquired and got to know the reason for his father’s misery. He went to meet Satyavati’s father and took a terrible vow to remain celibate throughout his life, thus removing the chance of having his own progeny. Due to his terrible vow, Devabrata came to be known as *Bhisma*. 

Pleased with his terrible vow, his father Santanu gave Bhisma the boon of control over his death, i.e. without his wish, he can’t die.

Apad Dharma are the duties and responsibilities of a king that should be followed in times of crisis. Moksha Dharma teaches about liberation and the knowledge of the self.
