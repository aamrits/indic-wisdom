## Birth and Lineage

Vishwamitra was the son of King *Gadhi*.

There was a king named Kusha, who was the manasputra (mental son) of Brahma. Kushanabha was his son. Though he was righteous, Kushanabha had 100 daughters and no son. After performing a sacrifice, his father, Kusha, granted him a boon of having a son.

*Gadhi* was born as his son. He had only one daughter, Satyavati, known for her exceptional virtues and a woman of the highest qualities. She was married to *Sage Richika*, the son of *Sage Brighu*. Later, Satyavati became the river Koushiki, flowing for the welfare of the world through the Himalayas.

Desiring a son for his father, Kushanabha, Satyavati asked Richika. The sage gave two pots of rice infused with mantras, one for Satyavati and another for her mother. Richika said that Satyavati would have a brahmana son devoted to spiritual pursuits, and Kushanabha would have a kshatriya ruler.

However, the rice pots got exchanged. Kushanabha had a kshatriya son, *Koushika*, who became the great aesthetic Vishwamitra. Satyavati’s grandson became *Lord Parashurama*, who, despite being born a brahmana, became a terrible warrior and got rid of evil kshatriyas 21 times from the earth.

## Rivalry with Vasistha

- Once Koushika was returning with his *Akshauhini* army and stayed in Sage Vasistha’s hermitage. Vasistha arranged a grand feast for Koushika and his entire army with the help of his cow, Shabala, a *kamadhenu*.

- A jealous Koushika asked Vasistha to give Shabala. When Vasistha refused, the king tried to take the cow by force. Thousands of armies emerged from the cow and destroyed Koushika’s army along with his sons.

- Defeated, Koushika went to the forest, pleased the gods and obtained all kinds of weapons. He returned to Vasistha’s hermitage and destroyed it. Filled with rage, Vasistha invoked the *Agneya* weapon on his staff. All the weapons of Koushika, including the *brahmastra*, were devoured by Vasistha’s staff. Thus, Koushika faced defeat again. 

- Koushika then decided to become a brahmana. After thousands of years of penance and austerities, all the gods alongwith Brahma, came and conferred on him the status of brahmarshi. Even Vasistha acknowledged, and Koushika got the status of *brahmarshi*. Koushika came to be known as *Vishwamitra*.

## Ramayana & Mahabharata

- Vishwamitra had obtained the knowledge of all the weapons known to the world. In Bala Kanda, he gave that knowledge to Rama.

- Vishwamitra took Rama to Mithila and was responsible for the marriage of Rama and Sita. Rama also broke the Shiva Dhanush, which was in the custody of King *Janaka*.

- Vishwamitra created an alternate universe for King *Trishanku* of the *Ikshvaku* dynasty. He also saved *Shunahshepa*, Richika’s middle son and his nephew, from being sacrificed. 

- *Menaka*, an *apsara*, successfully incited Vishwamitra’s lust and passion. They stayed together for 10 years, and Vishwamitra had a daughter named *Shankuntala*. Later, she married *Dushyanta* and had a son, *Bharata*.

- In the Mahabharata, there was a dialogue between Vishwamitra and a meat-seller about whether the sage should eat meat to survive or leave the meat as its impure and forbidden for a brahmana. Due to a great famine, Vishwamitra had become lifeless due to hunger, and he argued that a man should protect his life at any cost, and this is his highest *dharma*.
