## Birth and Lineage

She was the daughter of *Drupada*, the king of *Panchala*. Long ago, Drupada used to be childhood friends with Drona, the son of *Sage Bharadvaja*. Later, when Drupada became king, he refused Drona's friendship. Insulted by this, Drona asked his disciples, the Pandavas and the Kauravas, to defeat the Panchalas.

The Pandavas defeated Drupada with significant help from Arjuna. *Drona* took half of Drupada’s kingdom. Feeling insulted, Drupada wished for the death of Drona. He performed a *yajna* (sacrifice), and out of the sacrificial fire came *Dhristadyumna* and *Droupadi*.

Dhrishtadyumna slew Drona on the 15th day of the Mahabharata war.

## Droupadi's marriage

Even though Drupada felt insulted by Drona, he always admired Arjuna’s skills. He designed the contest for Droupadi’s swayamvara, suitable for only archers. To win Droupadi in the swayamvara ceremony, Arjuna strung the bow and shot five arrows at the target. Arjuna and Bhima defeated the assembled kings.

Arjuna won Droupadi in a *swayamvara*, but later all the Pandavas married her due to the confusing choice of words by their mother *Kunti*. Yuddhishthira agreed to Kunti’s words.

However, Drupada was not willing. *Sage Vyasa* arrived and disclosed Droupadi’s previous births and approved of Droupadi’s marriage. Finally, Drupada agreed. Vyasa blessed Droupadi with the boon that she will be ritually purified and will regain her virginity, thus preserving both her chastity and the alignment with dharma.

*Sage Narada* also came and asked the Pandavas to establish a rule among themselves to avoid any dissension that might arise. Droupadi was to be the wife of any one of the Pandavas for a year, and if any one of them set eyes on Draupadi when she was lying with any other Pandava, then he would live a life of a *brahmachari* for 12 years.

## Virtuous nature

- There is a conversation between Droupadi and *Satyabhama*, the wife of Krishna, about how to be an ideal wife. Droupadi tells about her conduct and the duties she carried out while she was the queen of Indraprastha. Because of this, the Pandavas were always devoted to her. 

- Droupadi took care of her husband, her mother-in-law *Kunti*, the close relatives and friends of the Pandavas. She also ensured the welfare of all the servants, brahmanas and other dignitaries. She managed the expenditure and inexhaustible wealth of the Pandavas, without showing anger, vanity and desire.

- Droupadi described to Satyabhama the qualities of a virtuous and ideal wife.

## Major Episodes

- In the fateful dice game, Yuddhishthira lost everything, his palace, his wealth, his brothers, himself and at last Droupadi. *Dushasana* dragged Droupadi into the assembly hall when she was in her menses and wearing a single garment. She asked how Yuddhishthira put her on stake when he had lost himself. No one could answer her. Only Vidura protested. Droupadi was always haughty towards Yuddhishthira.

- Even after the Pandavas had lost everything, using two boons from Dhritarastra, Droupadi asked for their freedom alongwith their weapons. Seeing this, Karna praised her in front of the Pandavas. 

- While in the 13 years of exile, Droupadi was abducted by King *Jayadratha* and by the rakshasa *Jatasura*. Bhima saved Jayadratha’s head and killed Jatasura.

- Droupadi lived as a servant in the kingdom of *Virata*. Kichaka, the general of the king, kicked her on the head in the presence of the king and Yuddhishthira. Bhima killed Kichaka with his 105 sons, creating fear around Droupadi.

- Bhima always came to aid Droupadi when she was in distress. It was Bhima who killed *Kichaka* and his sons. Bhima obtained the divine lotus flowers from Kubera after defeating the yakshas and rakshasa. Bhima was most angry when Droupadi faced humiliation in the dice game.

- Droupadi lost his sons, father and brothers in the Mahabharata war. Only his five husbands, the Pandavas, survived.

## Busting Myths

- *Karna* failed to string the bow in Droupadi’s swayamvara.

- Droupadi never said to Duryodhana, the son of the blind is blind, in the assembly of *Indraprastha*. It was Duryodhana’s jealousy that knew no bounds, and seeing the prosperity of the Pandavas, he became pale. His greed and envy towards the Pandavas resulted in the war.

- At the time of the Mahabharata war, Droupadi stayed in *Upaplavya*, in the Virata kingdom. Only after *Abhimanyu’s* death, she, along with *Subhadra*, *Uttara* and other women, arrived at the Pandavas’ camp.

- Droupadi had never washed her open hair with the blood of Dushasana, nor had she pledged to keep her hair open.

- The episode where Sage *Durvasa* came with his disciples to the Pandavas and Droupadi, after they had finished their meal, and Krishna saved them, is a later interpolation.  

- Droupadi always had a soft spot for Arjuna. That’s why on the way to heaven, Droupadi left her body first. 

(Note: The above points are not mentioned in the *BORI critical edition of the Mahabharata*. Might be a later interpolation.)
