Sage *Vasiṣṭha* stands as one of the foremost Ṛṣis of the Vedic tradition.

a sage whose wisdom was lived, not merely spoken.

## Lineage

Vasiṣṭha is traditionally regarded as a **mānasa-putra**
(mental son) of <span lang="sa">ब्रह्मा</span> (*Brahmā*).

He is counted among the **Sapta Ṛṣis** and is married to
<span lang="sa">अरुन्धती</span> (*Arundhatī*),
who is herself revered as an ideal of marital harmony.

## Role in Itihāsa and Purāṇa

In the *Rāmāyaṇa*, Vasiṣṭha serves as the **kulaguru**

He guides King Daśaratha and later Lord Rāma,
ensuring that royal power remains anchored in dharma
and spiritual restraint.

## Key Narratives and Episodes

The celebrated conflict between Vasiṣṭha and Sage *Viśvāmitra*
symbolizes the tension between **kṣātra-tejas**
(royal power) and **brahma-tejas** (spiritual power).

Through patience and inner mastery,
Vasiṣṭha demonstrates that true authority arises
from self-realization rather than force.

The *Yoga Vāsiṣṭha* presents Vasiṣṭha as a compassionate teacher
addressing Rāma’s existential despair.

He teaches that bondage and liberation are states of mind,
and that clarity (*viveka*) alone dissolves suffering.
