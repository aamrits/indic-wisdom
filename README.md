# Indic Wisdom.

There is an ever-lasting wisdom which is flowing from India and therefore it is called the land of light or knowledge. Bharata means a place where people seek knowledge (or light) and many many people have devoted their life in pursuit of knowledge. This application is an attempt to give a brief description to the various such personalities and the concepts of certain words which are synonous with the Indian Heritage and Culture.

## Use this project is built

Most of the codebase is built with the simple approach of "typing in google and do the monkey-see-monkey-do" kind of programming. 

My main focus was to build a good collection of accurate content and not to perfect the code quality. I focused on unique and good content so that it will provide some value to the readers. 

However, modern coding standards has been followed by taking inputs from chatGPT and other documentions.

## Features

- It uses React + Vite template for faster rendering.
- It uses `react-d3-cloud` to build the word-cloud. 
- For reading the `.md` files, libraries such as `react-markdown`, `remark-gfm`, `rehype-raw` are used.
- The content was made largely based on self-reading of several Indian scriptures and texts, various relevant websites related to Indic texts. Help has been taken from AI to refine and organise content.
